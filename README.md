# üß† EU AI Act Compliance Checker

**Author:** [Nico Roddz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoroddz/)  
**Website:** [AI Governance 101](https://www.aigovernance101.com)

A Streamlit-powered governance app that helps organizations assess and document compliance with the **EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act)**.

It identifies risk classifications, maps obligations (Articles 9‚Äì15), and generates both **machine-readable JSON** and **human-readable PDF** compliance reports ‚Äî combining transparency, accountability, and automation in one open-source prototype.

## üöÄ Features

### üß© Core functionality
- **AI risk classification** under the EU AI Act (Annex III)
- **Obligation tracking** for Articles 9‚Äì15: risk management, data quality, documentation, transparency, oversight, and cybersecurity
- **Dynamic dashboards** with KPI cards and compliance progress bars
- **Interactive form** to update obligation status and recalculate compliance score
- **Automatic SHA-256 hash** generation for audit integrity

### üìÑ Dual export system
| Format | Purpose | Output Folder |
|:-------|:---------|:--------------|
| **JSON** | Machine-readable data for integration or Power BI dashboards | `/reports/json/` |
| **PDF** | Executive-ready, timestamped compliance summary | `/reports/pdf/` |

Both export options contain identical content, ensuring perfect alignment between technical evidence and human-readable reporting.

### üí° Advanced capabilities
- Timestamped report versioning (`system_id + timestamp`)
- Visual analytics built with Plotly
- SHA-256 hash embedded in each report for verification
- Auto-generated compliance percentage and risk score
- Future-ready hooks for OneTrust, ServiceNow, or Power BI integration
